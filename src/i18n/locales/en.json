        "question": "How does the AI Audio Generator work?",
        "answer": "Super simple! Just 3 steps: 1) Choose one of the 190+ ultra-realistic premium multilingual voices (the same voice speaks any language!). 2) Paste your script and generate the audio with one click. 3) Download the MP3 audio file along with the perfectly synchronized SRT subtitle file, ready to import into Premiere, CapCut, or any editor."
      },
      "unlimited": {
        "question": "Is audio generation unlimited?",
        "answer": "The audio limit is daily, not monthly. Depending on your plan, you can generate 15 to 60 audios per day. This means you can generate hundreds of audios per month! The counter resets every day at midnight."
      },
      "charLimit": {
        "question": "Is there a monthly character limit?",
        "answer": "No! The character limit is per audio generation, not per month. So you can generate 50 audios in a day, each with up to 150 thousand characters (depending on the plan), no problem at all. Use it freely!"
      },
      "voiceQuality": {
        "question": "Are the voices really professional quality?",
        "answer": "Yes! We use cutting-edge voice synthesis technology with over 190 ultra-realistic premium voices. They're indistinguishable from human narrators, perfect for Dark channels that need studio quality without spending fortunes on voice-over."
      },
      "capcut": {
        "question": "Can I use the audios in CapCut and Premiere?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You get the audio in high-quality MP3 + SRT file with automatically synchronized subtitles. Just drag and drop into CapCut, Premiere, DaVinci, or any editor. The subtitles already come at the right time!"
      },
      "viralNiches": {
        "question": "What is Viral Niches and how does it work?",
        "answer": "Viral Niches automatically monitors YouTube 24/7 looking for channels that are exploding. When we detect a new channel with viral potential, you receive a notification in the system warning that a new niche is booming. This way you always stay one step ahead of the competition!"
      },
      "channels": {
        "question": "How many channels can I use?",
        "answer": "As many as you want! You can create and manage unlimited channels. There's no project limit on any plan. Dark Planner creators manage from 2 to 15+ channels simultaneously."
      },
      "niche": {
        "question": "Does it work for any Dark niche?",

      },
      "difficulty": {
